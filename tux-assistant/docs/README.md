# Tux Assistant Documentation

Tux Assistant is a system configuration tool for Linux. It handles the stuff you'd normally do in the terminal—installing software, setting up development tools, configuring network shares—through a clean graphical interface.

## Who is this for?

Anyone running Linux who wants to get things done without memorizing terminal commands. Whether you're new to Linux or just tired of looking up the same commands over and over, Tux Assistant has you covered.

## Supported Distributions

- **Arch-based**: Arch, EndeavourOS, Manjaro, Garuda
- **Debian-based**: Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Zorin
- **Fedora-based**: Fedora, Nobara
- **openSUSE**: Tumbleweed, Leap

The app detects your distribution automatically and uses the right package manager behind the scenes.
